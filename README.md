**Abstract:** 
The way to measure the extent of damage from floods and droughts is to identify changes in the extent of water systems. In order to effectively grasp this at a glance, satellite images are used. KOMPSAT-5 uses Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) to capture images regardless of weather conditions such as clouds and rain. In this paper, various deep learning models are applied to perform semantic segmentation of the water system in this SAR image and the performance is compared. The models used are U-net, V-Net, U2-Net, UNet 3+, PSPNet, Deeplab-V3, Deeplab-V3+ and PAN. In addition, performance comparison was performed when the data was augmented by applying elastic deformation to the existing SAR image dataset. As a result, without data augmentation, U-Net was the best with IoU of 97.25% and pixel accuracy of 98.53%. In case of data augmentation, Deeplab-V3 showed IoU of 95.15% and V-Net showed the best pixel accuracy of 96.86%.
